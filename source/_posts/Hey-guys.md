## <font face="Times New Roman" >Here's my very first post. Welcome！
## <font face="Times New Roman " >Thanks to *Github* and *Hexo*, I can build this blog so easy.By the way, I don't no what can I post yet, but I do get some ideas.The biggest question, recently, is whether I take this blog as a new weibo, or just let it be a tech-shared corner.
## <font face="Times New Roman ">What ever it will be, it should be very interesting. I'm sure about it.
## <font face="Times New Roman ">Music, cartoons, photography, codes and projects,there are so much fun I want to share.Please wait for a while, just after I've sorted out my thoughts, I might post more articles. Emmm, I mean, "might".
## <font face="Times New Roman ">And guys, don't forget to follow my github "senkuu-ai" and you can view my personal homepage throuth *https://github.com/SenKuu-ai*, or click the lovely kitty in the upper right corner.I have uploaded several personal projects in my repositories, and some have not been loaded yet, because the file locations of these projects are so scattered.Anyway, I really need you! ~~(How would I tell you I just want your stars indeed`hahah)~~
## <font face="Times New Roman ">There are also many interesting projects that have not been completed yet, I will finish them one day. You ask which day is "one day"? Sorry, I don't know either.
## <font face="Times New Roman ">So, that's all.Thanks for watching. See you in next blog.（Shall I wirte every article in English? This seems to be a good chance to improve English writing skills.）
